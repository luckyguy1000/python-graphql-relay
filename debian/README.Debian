python-graphql-relay for Debian
-------------------------------

We don't build binary package python-graphql-relay for Python2:
It depends on python*-promise which has no working Python 2 version.

This Python module is required needed by Python modules graphene. They are
used only forfor king-phisher which only supports Python 3.
